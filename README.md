## Git vs. GitHub
Git is a version control which keeps _snapshots_ of the code and does not require github.   
Github can see the changes you make, stores code in the cloud and you can collaborate with anyone on files.

In order to set up a repository follow these steps  
1. Then put `git init` it initializes the directory and is only done once.  
2. Make a repository by typing `mkdir` which make a new repository, then type the name that you want to give that file so you can remember which file is which when trying to find a subject for a specific work.     
3. Then you type `cd (name of the file)`,`cd` mkaes you go inside the repository, type `pwd`, it helps you see in which file you are currently working on.    
4. After you finish your work or want to save it to github to save your work you put `git add README` which means you are adding changes to the repository  
5. Then put `git commit -m "file name"` which saves the snapshots of your code to your remote of github.
